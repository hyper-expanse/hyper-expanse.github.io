# Developer Certificate of Origin

All contributors MUST certify they are able and willing to contribute under the terms of a project's license by signing off to a [_Developer Certificate of Origin_](https://developercertificate.org/).

## DCO Sign-off On Every Contribution

A DCO sign-off MUST be acquired on every contribution.

A sign-off ensures the contributor has agreed to submit their contribution under the terms of the project's license.

### Sign-off Implicit for Some

Some organizations have chosen to make the sign-off process implicit.

1. [GitLab has taken the stance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/43293#note_90822944) that the act of submitting a contribution is acknowledgement of the DCO.

### Apache-2.0 Has That Requirement Already

> This section only applies if you are using the Apache-2.0 license for your project.

While the [Apache-2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) has _Clause 5_ that states a contribution, unless stated otherwise, `shall be under the terms and conditions of this License`, it's not apparent that the contribution triggers that clause, or otherwise triggers the license [CITATION NEEDED].

An explicit sign-off also protects the project by ensuring there's evidence that a contributor agreed to license their contribution under the terms of the project's license [2].
