# Organization Management

A guide for configuring organizations.

## GitHub Organization

- Setup _Pinned repositories_ using the three most popular projects.

**Profile**

- Leave _Organization display name_ empty so that it uses the org name. (Optional)
- Add a description.
- Add billing address using an e-mail that belongs to someone who is actively involved in the project, or an e-mail group if appropriate.
- Add logo with a transparent background where the logo itself is black and white so that it works across different media formats.

**Member privileges**

- Disable _Allow members to create repositories for this organization_ to ensure repositories are only created that align with the organization's goals.

**Security**

- Enable _Require two-factor authentication_.

**Verified Domains**

- Verify all domains that will be listed within the organization settings.

**Third-party access**

- Enable third-party access restrictions so that only approved applications and services can access the organization.

**Projects**

- Disable all Projects (Optional).

## GitHub Team

- Add description.
- Do **not** create a top-level organization team. There should not be a monolithic team.
- Add a logo. It should be the same as the one used for the organization.
