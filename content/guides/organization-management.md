# GitHub Organization Management

A guide for configuring organizations.

## GitHub Organization

- Setup _Pinned repositories_ using the three most popular projects.

**Profile**

- Leave _Organization display name_ empty so that it uses the org name. (Optional)
- Add a description.
- Add billing address using an e-mail that belongs to someone who is actively involved in the project, or an e-mail group if appropriate.
- Add logo with a transparent background where the logo itself is black and white so that it works across different media formats.

**Security**

- Enable _Require two-factor authentication_.

**Verified Domains**

- Verify all domains that will be listed within the organization settings.

**Third-party access**

- Enable third-party access restrictions so that only approved applications and services can access the organization.

## GitHub Team

A dedicated team, perhaps named "GitHub Team", may consist of Org owners responsible for managing the configuration of the Org, and streamlining the developer experience to the extent possible at the Org level.

- Add description.
- Do **not** create a top-level organization team. There should not be a monolithic team.
- Add a logo. It should be the same as the one used for the organization.
