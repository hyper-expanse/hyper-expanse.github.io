</code></pre><p>To append the <code>Signed-off-by</code> line automatically, pass the <code>-s</code>, or <code>--signoff</code>, flag to <code>git commit</code>:</p><pre><code class=language-bash>git commit --signoff
</code></pre><p>Git will use the name and e-mail address configured in the Git configuration file to automatically append the line to the commit message.</p><h2 id=sign-off>Sign-off</h2><p>A DCO sign-off MUST be appended to every commit contained in a contribution.</p><p>An explicit sign-off is an indication that the contributor has read the DCO and is able, and willing, to provide their contributions under the terms of the project&rsquo;s license.</p><h3 id=implicit-for-some>Implicit for Some</h3><p>Some organizations have chosen to make the sign-off process implicit. For those instances it&rsquo;s not necessary to sign-off on individual commits. Instead, the contribution itself is indication that you are making your contribution available under the terms of the project&rsquo;s license.</p><ol><li><a href=https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/43293#note_90822944>GitLab has taken the stance</a> that the act of submitting a contribution is acknowledgement of the DCO.</li></ol><p>Since a sign-off is merely appended to each commit, an explicit sign-off, while not required by these organizations, may still be a good idea to avoid any later confusion by yourself, or the project, as to whether the contributions were intentionally contributed under the terms of the project&rsquo;s license. [CITATION NEEDED]</p><h3 id=apache-2-0-has-that-requirement-already>Apache-2.0 Has That Requirement Already</h3><blockquote><p>This section only applies if a project is using the Apache-2.0 license.</p></blockquote><p>While the <a href=https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html>Apache-2.0 license</a> has <em>Clause 5</em>, which states a contribution, unless stated otherwise, <code>shall be under the terms and conditions of this License</code>, it&rsquo;s not apparent that the contribution triggers that clause or otherwise triggers the license [CITATION NEEDED].</p><p>Therefore, an explicit sign-off protects the project by ensuring there&rsquo;s evidence a contributor agreed to make their contribution under the terms of the project&rsquo;s license [2][3].</p><h2 id=an-alternative-to-contributor-license-agreement>An Alternative to Contributor License Agreement</h2><p>As pointed out by Richard Fontana in his article, <a href=https://opensource.com/article/19/2/cla-problems><em>CLA Problems</em></a>, there are arguments in favor of Contributor License Agreements. Those arguments, however, may not be fully justified, and the cost of enforcing a CLA may out weight any value from the risk mitigated by that CLA.</p><h2 id=other-users-of-dco>Other Users of DCO</h2><ul><li><a href=https://www.eclipse.org/legal/DCO.php>Eclipse Foundation</a>.</li><li><a href=https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin>Linux Kernel</a>.</li><li><a href=https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2017-11-01-gitlab-transitions-contributor-license.html>GitLab</a></li></ul><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol><li><a href=https://developercertificate.org/>Developer Certificate</a></li><li><a href=https://www.scala-lang.org/news/license-change.html>Intent to adopt the Apache License 2.0 for Scala</a></li><li><a href=https://lwn.net/Articles/592503/>The most powerful contributor agreement</a></li></ol></div></body></html>
